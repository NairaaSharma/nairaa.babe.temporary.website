<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    This application ("Multi-Platform Upload App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data and what steps we take to ensure it remains secure.
</p>

<h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
<p>
    The app does not collect or store any personal data on our servers. All video files are processed locally on your machine and uploaded directly to the selected platform using their respective APIs.
</p>

<h3>2. Use of OAuth Authorization</h3>
<p>
    The app uses OAuth 2.0 for YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook to obtain authorization to upload videos. Tokens are stored temporarily and not reused beyond their intended purpose.
</p>

<h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>
    This app interacts with the YouTube Data API, Instagram Graph API, and Facebook Graph API to facilitate video uploads. For more information, refer to their privacy policies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">YouTube Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy" target="_blank">Instagram Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation" target="_blank">Facebook Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Security</h3>
<p>
    We take reasonable measures to ensure that your data is handled securely. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data during transmission to YouTube servers.
</p>

<h3>5. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page, and continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of these changes.
